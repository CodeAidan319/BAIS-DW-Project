# NFL Player Value Analysis (2022–2024)
BAIS:3250 – Data Wrangling Final Project  
Author: Aidan Terrill

## Overview

This project looks at whether NFL players are paid fairly based on their performance. I focused on quarterbacks (QBs), running backs (RBs), and wide receivers (WRs) during the 2022–2024 seasons. I scraped salary data from OverTheCap and performance stats from Pro Football Reference, then combined the data to see which players and positions offer the most value for what they’re paid.

## Goals

- Compare salary to performance across positions and seasons
- Create metrics to measure player value
- Identify underpaid or overpaid players
- Use machine learning to predict salary from performance
