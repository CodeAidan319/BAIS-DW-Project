# Project Report: NFL Player Value Analysis

This report is the final written component of the BAIS:3250 – Data Wrangling course project. It summarizes my analysis of how NFL player salaries compare to their on-field performance across the 2022–2024 seasons.

## Contents

The report includes:
- Background on salary efficiency in the NFL
- Data sources and web scraping methods
- Custom performance metrics (e.g., Stat_Total, Value_Index)
- Visualizations of top/bottom players by value
- Hypothesis testing comparing RBs and QBs
- Machine learning models predicting salary based on performance

## Purpose

The report explores whether players are being compensated fairly, identifies undervalued and overpaid players, and evaluates how much of salary variation can be explained by performance. It uses real-world data and techniques like scraping, merging, normalization, and regression modeling.
